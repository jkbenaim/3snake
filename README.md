3snake - dump sshd and sudo credential related strings
---

About
---
Targeting rooted servers, reads memory from `sshd` and `sudo` system calls that handle password based authentication. Doesn't write any memory to the traced processes. Spawns a new process for every `sshd` and `sudo` command that is run.

Listens for the `proc` event using netlink sockets to get candidate processes to trace. When it receives an `sshd` or `sudo` process `ptrace` is attached and traces `read` and `write` system calls, extracting strings related to password based authentication.

Don't really like the solution of backdooring openssh or installing a kernel module on target servers so I made this.
